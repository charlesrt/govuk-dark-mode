Dark Mode GOV.UK prototype: Using `prefers-colour-scheme` CSS media query.

View [prototype](https://govuk-dark-mode.herokuapp.com) on Heroku (including install instructions if you want to run your own copy).

You'll need [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) and MacOS Mojave to test Dark Mode working.

Based on article: [The Dark (Mode) Web Rises](http://charlesrt.uk/blog/the-dark-web-rises/)

I used some new GOV.UK colours from this [closed pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/611) and had to take liberties with others to get to a passable contrast level. Still needs more work to be properly compliant.
